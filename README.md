# Patatap-Clone
Patatap Clone is animation and sound kit that plays specific sound for each key when an alphabet key is pressed on keyboard with an animation of shrinking colorful circles. Patatap Clone is similar to <a href="http://patatap.com/">Patatap</a>. Patatap clone was made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (PaperScirpt) as a part of Web Developer course that I did on Udemy. If you want to listen to the sounds please <a href="https://github.com/harshp814/Patatap-Clone/blob/master/PatatapDemo.mp4>download</a> the video.
